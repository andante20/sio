# sio, a socket.io debugger

Sio was created because I was frustrated with making temporary index files and mashing F5 when I wanted to test or debug socket.io applications.

Installation:

```
npm install -g sio
```

It's a terminal app. Features:

 * Connect to any socket.io 1.0+ server
 * Filtering of incoming events
 * Pausing and unpausing output
 * Emitting your own events
 * More to come?
